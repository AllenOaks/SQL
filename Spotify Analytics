#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle and created a table to insert the data into.
#I then created several queries to explore the data using SQL.

#Table created: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#After I inserted the Sptofy Data .csv into the table.
#I then explored the data using the following SQL.


#Here, I calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
#Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH average_popularity_CTE AS (
    SELECT
        s.artist_name
        , AVG(s.popularity) as average_popularity
        FROM Spotifydata s
        GROUP BY s.artist_name
    )
SELECT artist_name
    , average_popularity
    , 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM average_popularity_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
ORDER BY average_popularity DESC;
